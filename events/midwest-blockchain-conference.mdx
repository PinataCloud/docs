Get started building with Pinata, including a how-to and tutorials

## **What is Pinata?**

Pinata makes decentralized file uploads _simple_ for developers who need fast, scalable, and zero-setup solutions. Our API and SDK make it as easy as one line of code to upload or retrieve files with IPFS.

**Copy to Upload Files**

```
const { cid } = await pinata.upload.public.file(file)

// Your CID
```

**Copy to Retrieve Files**

```
const { data, contentType } = await pinata.gateways.public.get(  
"Paste your CID"
)
```

Pinata helps developers, from university hackers to major Crypto teams, easily build on IPFS. Whether you’re minting NFTs, deploying a decentralized app, or experimenting at a hackathon, we’ve got you covered.
