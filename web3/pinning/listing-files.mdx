To list the files on your account you can either use the [SDK](/ipfs-sdk/data/list-files) or the [Pinata API](/api-reference/endpoint/list-files) to fetch file data programatically.

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata-web3";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const files = await pinata.listFiles().name("pinnie")
```

## Filters

### name

- Type: `string`

Name of the file

```typescript
const files = await pinata
  .listFiles()
  .name('pinnie')
```

### cid

- Type: `string`

CID of the file

```typescript
const files = await pinata
  .listFiles()
  .cid('rbafkreih5aznjvttude6c3wbvqeebb6rlx5wkbzyppv7garjiubll2ceym4r')
```

### group

- Type: `string`

Filter by `groupId`

```typescript
const files = await pinata
  .listFiles()
  .group('648767d5-0a80-4b3a-9669-93693e4a0519')
```

### keyValue

- Type: `object`

Filter files by `keyValue` objects used in Pinata Metadata

```typescript
const files = await pinata
  .listFiles()
  .keyValues("whimsey", 100)
```

This also includes an optional `operator` for even more fine tuned data

Type:
```typescript
operator?:
		| "gt" // Greater than
		| "gte" // Greater or equal to
		| "lt" // Less than
		| "lte" // Less than or equal to
		| "ne" // Not equal
		| "eq" // Equal
		| "between"
		| "notBetween"
		| "like"
		| "notLike"
		| "iLike"
		| "notILike"
		| "regexp"
		| "iRegexp";
```

```typescript
const files = await pinata
  .listFiles()
  .keyValues("whimsey", 400, "lt")
```

### pageLimit

- Type: `number`

Determine the number of results, default is `10`, max is `1000`

```typescript
const files = await pinata
  .listFiles()
  .pageLimit(100)
```
### pageOffset

- Type: `number`

Offset the number of files returned to paginate

```typescript
const files = await pinata
  .listFiles()
  .pageOffset(100)
```

### pinStart

- Type: `string`

Filter by start date in ISO8601 format

```typescript
const files = await pinata
  .listFiles()
  .pinStart('2024-07-16T11:41:19Z')
```

### pinEnd

- Type: `string`

Filter by end date in ISO8601 format

```typescript
const files = await pinata
  .listFiles()
  .pinEnd('2024-07-16T11:41:19Z')
```

### pinSizeMin

- Type: `number`

Filter by minimum file size in bytes

```typescript
const files = await pinata
  .listFiles()
  .pinSizeMin('100000')
```

### pinSizeMax

- Type: `number`

Filter by maximum file size in bytes

```typescript
const files = await pinata
  .listFiles()
  .pinSizeMax('1000000')
```

## Auto Paginate

The `listFiles` method has an auto pagination feature that is triggered when used inside a `for await` iterator

```typescript
for await (const item of pinata.listFiles().name("pinnie") {
  console.log(item.ipfs_pin_hash);
}
```

Works like magic ✨

## Advance Querying with the API

You also have the option to query your content on the associated metadata that may have been included with the content when it was uploaded.

These queries look very similar to the default parameters but are slightly more complex. Here are few simple examples, with added explanation afterward:

To query on the name you provided for your pin, your query would take this form:

```
?metadata[name]=exampleName
```

(This will match on names that contain the string of characters provided as a value. For added specificity, please include the full name you're trying to find).

To query on the metadata key-value attributes:

```
?metadata[keyvalues]={"exampleKey":{"value":"exampleValue","op":"exampleOp"}}
```

OR

```
?metadata[keyvalues][exampleKey]={"value":"exampleValue","op":"exampleOp"}
```

To query on both the metadata name and multiple key-value attributes:

```
?metadata[name]=exampleName&metadata[keyvalues]={"exampleKey":{"value":"exampleValue","op":"exampleOp"},"exampleKey2":{"value":"exampleValue2","op":"exampleOp2"}}
```

### Explaining the "value" and "op" key / values

As seen above, each query on custom values takes the form of an object with a "value" key and an "op" key.

The "value" is fairly straightforward. This is simply the value that you wish your query operation to be applied to. These values can be:

### Strings

Numbers (integers or decimals)

Dates (Provided in ISO_8601 format)

The `op` is what query operation will be applied to the value you provided. The following opcodes are available to query with:

`gt` - (greater than)

`gte` - (greater than or equal)

`lt` - (less than)

`lte` - (less than or equal)

`ne` - (not equal to)

`eq` - (equal to)

`between` - (When querying with the 'between' operation, you need to supply a 'secondValue' to be consumed by the query operation)

For Example:

```
?metadata[keyvalues]={"exampleKey":{"value":"2018-01-01 00:00:00.000+00","secondValue":"2018-02-01 00:00:00.000+00","op":"between"}}
```

`notBetween` - (When querying with the `notBetween` operation, you need to supply a `secondValue` to be consumed by the query operation)

For Example:

```
?metadata[keyvalues]={"exampleKey":{"value":4.00,"secondValue":5.50,"op":"notBetween"}}
```

`like` - (you can use this to find values that are similar to what you've passed in)

For example, this query would find all entries that begin with "testValue". A % before your value means anything can come before it, and a % sign after means any characters can come after it. So %testValue% would contain all entries containing the characters "testValue".

```
?metadata[keyvalues]={"exampleKey":{"value":"testValue%","op":"like"}}
```

`notLike` - (you can use this to find values that do not contain the character string you've passed in)

`iLike` - (The case insensitive version of the "like" opcode)

`notILike` - (The case insensitive version of the "notLike" opcode)

`regexp` - (Regular expression matching)

`iRegexp` - (Case insensitive regular expression matching)
