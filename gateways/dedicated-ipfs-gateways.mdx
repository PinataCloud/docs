Dedicated Gateways are the fastest way to fetch content from IPFS, and are the ideal tool when building decentralized applications. When you create a Pinata account you'll automatically have a Dedicated Gateway created for you! To see it, simply visit the [Gateways Page]() see it listed there.

The gateway domains are randomly generated and might look something like this:

```

## Viewing Content Through Your Gateway

To view content through your gateway, grab the CID of the file you'd like to view and add it to your gateway URL like this:

Simple as that!

## Restricted vs Open

All Pinata Dedicated Gateways are restricted by default. This mean they will only serve CIDs that are pinned to your account, which keeps your gateway safe from abuse by outside actors who may want to use it for themselves. 

If you plan to upload content to your own account then use your gateway to fetch it, you shouldn't have to touch a thing and it will work as expected! However, lets say you're building a marketplace and you need to fetch content outside your account. In that case you will want to use [Gateway Access Controls](). Adding one of these will allow you to access CIDs from the public IPFS network, but it has to meet that access control condition, like a Gateway API Key or Host Origin requirement. Be sure to read our [docs on Gateway Access Controls]() to learn more.

<Note>The only way to open a Dedicated Gateway and allow any CID to go through is to add a Gateway Access Control</Note>

## Convert IPFS Links or Gateway URLs to use Your Dedicated Gateway

If you are a developer that is building an app that is indexing the blockchain, you will likely come across multiple types of IPFS urls that might not be ideal to work with: 

```
ipfs://QmVLwvmGehsrNEvhcCnnsw5RQNseohgEkFNN1848zNzdng

https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVLwvmGehsrNEvhcCnnsw5RQNseohgEkFNN1848zNzdng
```

Pinata has you covered with a tool we built to help you in situations like this one. It can take IPFS urls, whether they are the protocol standard (`ipfs://`) or another gateway (`https://ipfs.io`) and turn then into your specified Dedicated Gateway. Check it out with the link below!

## Adding a Custom Domain

Pinata also allows you to create a custom domain for your dedicated gateway. Simply visit the [Gateways Page](doc:gateways),  click the menu button on the right side of your gateway, then click Add Custom Domain. You'll need to own the domain you want to use. When you enter your domain, you will be prompted to enter DNS information through your registrar.

## Billing and Usage

When it comes to using a Dedicated Gateway there are a few metrics Pinata uses for billing.

| Metric    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bandwidth | Bandwidth is the amount of data that is being going through your Gateway. For instance, if you have a 10MB file go through your gateway 100 times, that would be 1GB of bandwidth used for the month.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Requests  | A request is anytime content is queried through the gateway, so if you run `wget https://mygateway.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVLwvmGehsrNEvhcCnnsw5RQNseohgEkFNN1848zNzdng` in your terminal, that would be one request. Or if you had someone visit your app that uses the gateway on the client side, each time the website requests content from IPFS using the gateway, that's a request. |

Both of these metrics reset on a monthly basis based on your billing cycle. 

<Note>If you're using a Dedicated Gateway for your NFT project, be sure to check out [this guide](https://knowledge.pinata.cloud/en/articles/6461213-token-uris-in-nft-projects) on how you should do that.</Note>
