## What are Skills?

Skills are specialized plugins for Claude Code that extend its capabilities with domain-specific knowledge and workflows. They allow Claude to perform complex operations that would otherwise require multiple steps and API calls.

## Available Pinata Skills

Pinata provides two powerful skills that enable Claude Code to work seamlessly with IPFS storage and blockchain agent registration:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Pinata API" icon="cloud" href="/tools/skills/pinata-api">
    Manage files, groups, gateways, signatures, payments, and AI-powered vector search on Pinata's IPFS platform.
  </Card>
  <Card title="ERC-8004 Agent Registration" icon="robot" href="/tools/skills/pinata-erc-8004">
    Register and verify AI agents using the ERC-8004 standard with IPFS storage and on-chain transactions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting Started

Both skills are available on [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai), the registry for Claude Code skills:

- [Pinata API Skill](https://clawhub.ai/iammatthias/pinata-api)
- [ERC-8004 Agent Registration Skill](https://clawhub.ai/iammatthias/pinata-erc-8004)

### Installation

Install skills directly from ClawHub:

```bash
clawhub install pinata-api
clawhub install erc-8004-pinata
```

Or manually copy the skill directories to your Claude Code skills folder.

## How Skills Work

Once installed and configured with your API credentials, you can simply ask Claude Code to perform operations in natural language:

> "Upload this file to Pinata"

> "Create an ERC-8004 agent card for my AI assistant"

> "Register this agent on Base Sepolia"

Claude Code automatically uses the appropriate skill and handles all the API calls, file operations, and blockchain transactions for you.

## Configuration

Skills require environment variables to be set in your Claude Code configuration. Each skill documents its required credentials and setup steps.

See the individual skill pages for detailed setup instructions.
