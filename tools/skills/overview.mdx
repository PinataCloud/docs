## What are Skills?

Skills are specialized plugins for AI agents that extend their capabilities with domain-specific knowledge and workflows. They allow AI agents to perform complex operations that would otherwise require multiple steps and API calls.

These skills are designed for [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/).

## Available Pinata Skills

Pinata provides two powerful skills that enable AI agents to work seamlessly with IPFS storage and blockchain agent registration:

  <Card title="Pinata API" icon="cloud" href="/tools/skills/pinata-api">
    Manage files, groups, gateways, signatures, payments, and AI-powered vector search on Pinata's IPFS platform.
  </Card>
  <Card title="ERC-8004 Agent Registration" icon="robot" href="/tools/skills/pinata-erc-8004">
    Register and verify AI agents using the ERC-8004 standard with IPFS storage and on-chain transactions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting Started

Both skills are available on [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai), the registry for Claude Code skills:

- [Pinata API Skill](https://clawhub.ai/iammatthias/pinata-api)
- [ERC-8004 Agent Registration Skill](https://clawhub.ai/iammatthias/pinata-erc-8004)

### Installation

Install skills directly from ClawHub:

```bash
clawhub install pinata-api
clawhub install erc-8004-pinata
```

Or manually copy the skill directories to your Claude Code skills folder.

## How Skills Work

Once installed and configured with your API credentials in OpenClaw, you can simply ask your AI agent to perform operations in natural language:

> "Upload this file to Pinata"

> "Create an ERC-8004 agent card for my AI assistant"

> "Register this agent on Base Sepolia"

The AI agent automatically uses the appropriate skill and handles all the API calls, file operations, and blockchain transactions for you.

## Configuration

Skills require environment variables to be set in your OpenClaw configuration (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`). Each skill documents its required credentials and setup steps.

See the individual skill pages for detailed setup instructions.
