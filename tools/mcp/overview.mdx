---

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard that allows AI assistants like Claude to interact with external tools and services. MCP servers expose capabilities that AI models can use to perform actions on your behalf.

The **Pinata MCP server** gives Claude (and other MCP-compatible assistants) the ability to:

- Upload and manage files on IPFS (public and private)
- Search, retrieve, and delete files
- Organize files into groups
- Create gateway links for sharing content
- Set up content monetization with x402 payment instructions
- Vectorize files for semantic search
- Pin existing CIDs from the IPFS network

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A [Pinata account](https://app.pinata.cloud) with an [API key (JWT)](/account-management/api-keys)
- A [Pinata Gateway](/gateways/dedicated-ipfs-gateways) URL

## Installation

The Pinata MCP server is available on npm and can be run via `npx`. Installation depends on which Claude client you're using.

### Claude Code

Run `claude mcp add` and follow the prompts:

```
Server Name: pinata
Server Scope: Project or Global
Server Command: npx
Command Arguments: pinata-mcp /path/to/allowed/directory
Environment Variables: PINATA_JWT=<YOUR_JWT>,GATEWAY_URL=example.mypinata.cloud
```

### Claude Desktop

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pinata": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "pinata-mcp",
        "/path/to/allowed/directory",
        "/another/allowed/directory"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PINATA_JWT": "<YOUR_JWT>",
        "GATEWAY_URL": "example.mypinata.cloud"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
The directory arguments are optional and control which local directories the MCP server can access for file uploads. If not provided, the server only allows access to the current working directory. You can specify multiple directories.
</Note>

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Required | Description |
|---------------------|----------|-------------|
| `PINATA_JWT` | Yes | Your Pinata API JWT from the [API Keys page](https://app.pinata.cloud/developers/api-keys) |
| `GATEWAY_URL` | Yes | Your Pinata gateway domain (e.g., `example.mypinata.cloud`) |

## Verifying the Connection

Once installed, ask Claude to test the connection:

```
Test my Pinata authentication to make sure everything is working
```

Claude will use the `testAuthentication` tool to verify your JWT is valid.

## Next Steps

See the [Tools Reference](/tools/mcp/tools) for a complete list of available tools with parameters and example prompts.
