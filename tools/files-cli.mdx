## Installation

<Note>
If you are on Windows please use WSL when installing, as the current implementation will not work natively on Windows OS.
</Note>

We will be working on an install script, but for now there are a few other ways you can install the CLI.

### Homebrew

If you are on MacOS and have homebrew installed you can run the command below to install the CLI

```
brew install PinataCloud/files-cli/files-cli
```

### Building from Source

To build and instal from source make sure you have [Go](https://go.dev/) installed on your computer and the following command returns a version:

```shell
go version
```

Then paste and run the following into your terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PinataCloud/files-cli && cd files-cli && go install .
```

### Linux Binary

As versions are released you can visit the [Releases](https://github.com/PinataCloud/files-cli/releases) page and download the appropriate binary for your system, them move it into your bin folder.

For example, this is how I install the CLI for my Raspberry Pi

```
wget https://github.com/PinataCloud/files-cli/releases/download/v0.1.0/files-cli_Linux_arm64.tar.gz

tar -xzf files-cli_Linux_arm64.tar.gz

sudo mv pinata /usr/bin
```
