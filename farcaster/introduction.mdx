Farcaster is a decentralized social media protocol that runs on a combination of smart contracts on a blockchain and peer to peer servers called “Hubs.” Its similar to other social medias where you can have an account, follow other people, make posts, reply, and react to other’s posts. The primary difference is that since it is a protocol and decentralized, anyone can build their own interface/client on top of Farcaster. For instance, the most popular is [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com) and acts as the default, but there is also [Supercast](https://supercast.xyz) which has special paid features and [Tiles](https://v0.tiles.cool) that is image focused. 

Pinata has been watching and [writing](https://medium.com/pinata/how-to-build-a-video-app-on-farcaster-7e1943fcabe1) about Farcaster for a while now, but more recently has [dedicated more resources](https://www.pinata.cloud/blog/why-we-are-all-in-on-farcaster) to supporting the Farcaster network in the form of free and open hubs developers can use as well as other tools to accelerate apps and Frames. We believe IPFS has the ability to increase the potential of media rich clients building on Farcaster and we have the goal to make that seamless as possible. 

For more information on the Farcaster protocol check out their docs [here](https://docs.farcaster.xyz). If you’re ready to start building check out our [Hubs page](/farcaster/hubs) or our [Hub API Reference](/farcaster/api-reference)
