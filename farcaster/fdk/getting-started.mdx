The Farcaster Development Kit (FDK) is an SDK to make it easier to manage [Farcaster Auth](/farcaster/farcaster-auth), [Farcaster Writes](/farcaster/fdk/farcaster-writes), and [Farcaster Frames](/farcaster/fdk/farcaster/frames).

## Installation

```bash
npm i pinata-fdk
```
```bash
yarn add pinata-fdk
```

## Initialization

If you are going to be using Farcaster Auth you will need to provide your <Tooltip tip="This would be a separate Farcaster account you have created for your app, eg @photocast">Farcaster App FID</Tooltip>, and if you are using non-sponsored signers you will need to provide your mnemonic phrase as well.

```javascript
import { PinataFDK } from "pinata-fdk";

const fdk = new PinataFDK({
    pinata_jwt: "<YOUR_PINATA_JWT>",
    pinata_gateway: "", // gateway can be blank in this instance
    appFid: "<YOUR_APP_FID>",
    appMnemonic: "<YOUR_APP_MNEMONIC>"
});
```

If you are using just Farcaster Writes or Frame Analytics you only need the Pinata JWT in the instance.

```javascript
import { PinataFDK } from "pinata-fdk";

const fdk = new PinataFDK({
    pinata_jwt: "<YOUR_PINATA_JWT>",
    pinata_gateway: "", // gateway can be blank in this instance
});
```

If you want to leverage IPFS pinning capabilities, you must enter your Pinata JWT and a Pinata gateway during intialization. 

```javascript
import { PinataFDK } from "pinata-fdk";

const fdk = new PinataFDK({
    pinata_jwt: "<YOUR_PINATA_JWT>",
    pinata_gateway: "<YOUR_PINATA_GATEWAY>"}, 
);
```

If you are only using the frame metadata functionality, you do not need to enter your credentials. 

```javascript 
import { PinataFDK } from "pinata-fdk";

const fdk = new PinataFDK();
```
