<Note>
  x402 is available on paid Pinata accounts. [Upgrade your account](https://app.pinata.cloud/billing) to access x402 monetization features.
</Note>

Monetize your private IPFS files by receiving USDC payments directly to your wallet using the x402 protocol.

For detailed concepts and workflows, see the [x402 Introduction](/files/x402/intro).

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "your-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

// 1. Upload a private file
const file = new File(["premium content"], "content.pdf", { type: "application/pdf" });
const upload = await pinata.upload.private.file(file);

// 2. Create a payment instruction
const instruction = await pinata.x402.createPaymentInstruction({
  name: "Premium Content Access",
  payment_requirements: [
    {
      asset: "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913", // USDC on Base
      pay_to: "0xYourWalletAddress", // YOU receive payments here
      network: "base",
      amount: "10000", // $0.01 in USDC
    },
  ],
});

// 3. Attach CID to payment instruction
await pinata.x402.addCid(instruction.data.id, upload.cid);

// 4. Share the x402 gateway URL
// https://your-gateway.mypinata.cloud/x402/cid/{cid}
```

## Network Configuration

**USDC is currently the only supported token.**

| Network | USDC Token Address | Use Case |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Base (Mainnet) | `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` | Production monetization |
| Base Sepolia (Testnet) | `0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e` | Testing payment flows |

## Payment Amounts

USDC has 6 decimals. To convert USD to token amount, multiply by 1,000,000:

| USD | `amount` |
|-----|----------|
| $0.01 | `"10000"` |
| $0.10 | `"100000"` |
| $1.00 | `"1000000"` |
