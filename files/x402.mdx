<Note>
  x402 requires a feature flag to be enabled on your Pinata account. Contact team@pinata.cloud to request access.
</Note>

Pinata's x402 enables you to monetize your private IPFS files by receiving USDC payments directly to your wallet. You set the price, you receive the payment.

<Note>
  x402 is currently available through the Pinata API v3. SDK support coming soon.
</Note>

## Overview

Pinata's x402 implementation enables:
- **Monetization of private IPFS content** using Payment Instructions
- **You receive payments directly** to your wallet address. Payments go to you, not Pinata.
- **Flexible payment requirements** configurable per file or group of files
- **USDC payments** on Base (mainnet) and Base Sepolia (testnet)
- **Gateway-level enforcement** through the x402 protocol

## Network Configuration

| Network | USDC Token Address | Use Case |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Base (Mainnet) | `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` | Production monetization |
| Base Sepolia (Testnet) | `0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e` | Testing payment flows |

## Payment Instructions API

Create and manage payment requirements for your private content:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="List Instructions" icon="list" href="/api-reference/endpoint/x402/payment-instructions-list">
    View all payment instructions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create Instruction" icon="plus" href="/api-reference/endpoint/x402/payment-instructions-create">
    Define new payment requirements
  </Card>
  <Card title="Get Instruction" icon="eye" href="/api-reference/endpoint/x402/payment-instructions-get">
    Retrieve instruction details
  </Card>
  <Card title="Update Instruction" icon="pen" href="/api-reference/endpoint/x402/payment-instructions-update">
    Modify payment requirements
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delete Instruction" icon="trash" href="/api-reference/endpoint/x402/payment-instructions-delete">
    Remove payment instructions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## CID Management

Attach payment instructions to your private files:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="List CIDs" icon="folder" href="/api-reference/endpoint/x402/cids-list">
    View attached CIDs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Add CID" icon="link" href="/api-reference/endpoint/x402/cids-add">
    Attach CID to instruction
  </Card>
  <Card title="Remove CID" icon="unlink" href="/api-reference/endpoint/x402/cids-remove">
    Detach CID from instruction
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

1. **Upload** a private file to Pinata IPFS
2. **Create** a Payment Instruction with your desired payment requirements
3. **Attach** the CID of your private file to the Payment Instruction
4. **Share** your x402 gateway URL: `https://your-gateway.mypinata.cloud/x402/cid/{cid}`
5. **Requesters** make USDC payments through your gateway to access content

<Note>
  You must use your own dedicated Pinata gateway domain. Replace `your-gateway.mypinata.cloud` with your actual gateway domain throughout these examples.
</Note>

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a payment instruction
curl -X POST https://api.pinata.cloud/v3/x402/payment_instructions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Premium Content",
    "payment_requirements": [{
      "asset": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
      "pay_to": "0xYourWalletAddress",  // YOU receive payments here
      "network": "base",
      "description": "Access fee",
      "max_amount_required": "10000"
    }]
  }'
# Returns: {"data": {"id": "019a2b6a-...", ...}}

# 2. Attach CID to payment instruction
curl -X PUT https://api.pinata.cloud/v3/x402/payment_instructions/{instruction_id}/cids/{cid} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT"

# 3. Share the x402 gateway URL
# https://your-gateway.mypinata.cloud/x402/cid/{cid}
```

## Why Use Payment Instructions

The Payment Instructions API enables you to monetize your private content by setting custom payment requirements and receiving payments directly to your wallet.

Key benefits:
- **You get paid** for your content. Set your own prices and receive USDC payments directly.
- **Flexible pricing** for different files or groups of files
- **Reusable payment instructions** that can be attached to multiple CIDs
- **Full control** over payment requirements, pricing, and access

## Legacy Endpoints

These endpoints are maintained for backward compatibility:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="/pin (Legacy)" horizontal icon="upload" href="/api-reference/endpoint/x402/legacy-pin">
    Upload to either Public or Private IPFS
  </Card>
  <Card title="/retrieve (Legacy)" horizontal icon="download" href="/api-reference/endpoint/x402/legacy-retrieve">
    Access a file on Private IPFS
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
