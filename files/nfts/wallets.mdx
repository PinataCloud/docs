Add your wallet address to Pinata, then sync to fetch your NFT collections.

## Adding a Wallet

1. Go to [NFT Backup](https://app.pinata.cloud/nft-backup/wallets)
2. Click **Add Wallet**
3. Enter your wallet address
4. Click **Register**

## Syncing a Wallet

After adding a wallet, sync it to fetch your NFT collections:

1. Select a wallet
2. Click **Sync**

Syncing fetches your NFTs from OpenSea and extracts any IPFS CIDs from the metadata and images. This can take a few minutes depending on how many NFTs you have.

## Managing Wallets

From the wallets page you can:
- View sync status and CID counts
- Enable auto-backup
