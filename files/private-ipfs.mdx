IPFS has traditionally been a fully public network, so anything you pin can be accessed by anyone if they have the CID. While this is a benefit for a majority of blockchain applications, there are still cases where true privacy is needed. This is why Pinata has built Private IPFS, a new service that allows you to keep content private and only share when authorized.

## Private vs Public Network

Everything in the SDK and API have been separated by two networks: `public` and `private`. This means files and groups will be in separate resources and will be accessed by designating the network in either the SDK method or API route.

### Uploading

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
// Uploads a file to Public IPFS
const publicUpload = await pinata.upload.public.file(file)

// Uploads a file to Private IPFS
const privateUpload = await pinata.upload.private.file(file)
```

```typescript {11} API
const JWT = "PINATA_JWT";

async function uploadFile() {
  try {
    const text = "Hello World!";
    const blob = new Blob([text], { type: "text/plain" });
    const file = new File([blob], "hello-world.txt");
    const data = new FormData();
    data.append("file", file);
    // Upload a file to Public IPFS
    data.append("network", "public")

    const request = await fetch(
      "https://uploads.pinata.cloud/v3/files",
      {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
        },
        body: data,
      }
    );
    const response = await request.json();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Listing and Querying

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
// List public files
const files = await pinata.files.public.list()

// List private files
const files = await pinata.files.private.list()
```

```typescript {6,8} API
const JWT = "YOUR_PINATA_JWT";

async function files() {
  try {
    // Designate network to list either public or private files
    const network = "public"

    const url = `https://api.pinata.cloud/v3/files/${network}`,

    const request = await fetch(url, {
      method: "GET",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
      }
    });
    const response = await request.json();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Groups

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
// Create a public group
const group = await pinata.groups.public.create({
	name: "My Public Group",
});

// Create a private group
const group = await pinata.groups.private.create({
	name: "My Private Group",
});
```

```typescript {5,7} API
const JWT = "YOUR_PINATA_JWT";

async function group() {
  try {
    const network = "public"

    const endpoint = `https://api.pinata.cloud/v3/groups/${network}`

    const payload = JSON.stringify({
      name: "My Public Group",
    })

    const request = await fetch(endpoint, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
      },
      body: payload,
    });
    const response = await request.json();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>


## Accessing Private Files

With Public IPFS you can simply access a file through an IPFS Gateway with a CID. Since Private IPFS does not announce to the public IPFS network the only way you can access them is with a temporary access link. This can be generated with either the SDK or the API and set to expire after a designated number of seconds.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
const url = await pinata.gateways.private.createAccessLink({
	cid: "bafkreib4pqtikzdjlj4zigobmd63lig7u6oxlug24snlr6atjlmlza45dq", // CID of the file to access
	expires: 30, // Number of seconds the link is valid for
});
```

```typescript API
const JWT = "YOUR_PINATA_JWT";

async function createAccessLink() {
  try {

    // Endpoint for creating access links
    const url = "https://api.pinata.cloud/v3/files/download_link"

    // CID of the file you want to access
    const cid = "bafkreih5aznjvttude6c3wbvqeebb6rlx5wkbzyppv7garjiubll2ceym4"

    // Current Date
  	const date = Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / 1000);

    const data = JSON.stringify({
      url: `https://example.mypinata.cloud/files/${cid}`, // Gateway URL for the file using /files/ in the path
      expires: 180, // Number of seconds the link will be valid for
      date: date, // Current date of request
      method: "GET" // GET for accessing file
    })

    const request = await fetch(url, {
      method: "POSt",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      body: data
    });
    const response = await request.json();
    return response.data
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

## Monetizing Private Files

Want to get paid for access to your private content? Check out [x402 Monetization](/files/x402), which allows you to attach payment requirements to private files using USDC on Base.

## Example Apps

Pinata has built several example apps and tutorials you can reference to see how Private IPFS enables token gated experiences in blockchain and crpto contexts.
