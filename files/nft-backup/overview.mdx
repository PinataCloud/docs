Pin all IPFS content from your NFT collections to your Pinata account.

## Two Ways to Backup

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Manual Sync" icon="rotate">
    Sync your wallet on-demand and choose which CIDs to backup. Best for one-time backups or when you want full control over what gets pinned.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automated Backups" icon="clock">
    Enable auto-backup to automatically pin new CIDs whenever you sync. Set it and forget it—your NFTs stay protected.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

1. **Connect** - Add your wallet address
2. **Sync** - Pinata scans your wallet across supported chains and extracts IPFS CIDs
3. **Backup** - Pin CIDs to your Pinata account (manually or automatically)

Own multiple NFTs from the same collection? Shared assets are only pinned once, so you won't pay for duplicates.
