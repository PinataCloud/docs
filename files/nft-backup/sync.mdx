After syncing a wallet, backup the IPFS CIDs to your Pinata account. Own multiple NFTs from the same collection? Shared assets are only pinned once, so you won't pay for duplicates.

## Backup All

To backup all CIDs for a wallet:

1. Go to [NFT Backup](https://app.pinata.cloud/nft-backup/wallets)
2. Select a wallet
3. Click **Backup All**

Pinata pins all CIDs in the background. This can take a few minutes.

## Auto-Backup

2. Toggle **Auto-Backup** on
