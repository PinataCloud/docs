title: "Legacy x402"
---

<Warning>
  These endpoints represent an early implementation of the x402 protocol. For new implementations, please use the [Payment Instructions API](/files/x402-payment-instructions).
</Warning>

## Overview

The legacy x402 endpoints were Pinata's initial implementation of the x402 protocol for testing crypto-based content monetization. These endpoints use a simplified payment model and require the x402-axios or x402-fetch libraries.

## Endpoints

For detailed API specifications, see the API Reference:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Upload" icon="upload" href="/api-reference/endpoint/x402/legacy-pin">
    Upload files with payment
  </Card>
  <Card title="Retrieve" icon="download" href="/api-reference/endpoint/x402/legacy-retrieve">
    Access private files with payment
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Use Payment Instructions Instead

The Payment Instructions API offers:
- **Flexible pricing** - Set your own payment requirements
- **Better control** - Manage payment requirements separately from files
- **Standard protocol** - Works with the standard x402 implementation
- **One-to-many** - Attach one payment instruction to multiple files

For new projects, we recommend using the [Payment Instructions API](/files/x402-payment-instructions).
