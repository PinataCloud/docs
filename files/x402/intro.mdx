  x402 requires a feature flag to be enabled on your Pinata account. Contact team@pinata.cloud to request access.

Pinata's x402 enables you to monetize your private IPFS files by receiving USDC payments directly to your wallet. You set the price, you receive the payment.

## Overview

Pinata's x402 implementation enables:
- **Monetization of private IPFS content** using Payment Instructions
- **You receive payments directly** to your wallet address. Payments go to you.
- **Flexible payment requirements** configurable per file or group of files
- **USDC payments** on Base (mainnet) and Base Sepolia (testnet)
- **Gateway-level enforcement** through the x402 protocol

## Network Configuration

| Network | USDC Token Address | Use Case |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Base (Mainnet) | `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` | Production monetization |
| Base Sepolia (Testnet) | `0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e` | Testing payment flows |

## How It Works

1. **Upload** a private file to Pinata IPFS
2. **Create** a Payment Instruction with your desired payment requirements
3. **Attach** the CID of your private file to the Payment Instruction
4. **Share** your x402 gateway URL: `https://your-gateway.mypinata.cloud/x402/cid/{cid}`
5. **Requesters** make USDC payments through your gateway to access content

<Note>
  You must use your own dedicated Pinata gateway domain. Replace `your-gateway.mypinata.cloud` with your actual gateway domain throughout these examples.
</Note>

## Example Workflow

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "your-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

// 1. Upload a private file
const file = new File(["premium content"], "content.pdf", { type: "application/pdf" });
const upload = await pinata.upload.private.file(file);

// 2. Create a payment instruction
const instruction = await pinata.x402.createPaymentInstruction({
  name: "Premium Content",
  payment_requirements: [
    {
      asset: "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
      pay_to: "0xYourWalletAddress", // YOU receive payments here
      network: "base",
      description: "Access fee",
      amount: "10000", // $0.01 in USDC
    },
  ],
});

// 3. Attach CID to payment instruction
await pinata.x402.addCid(instruction.data.id, upload.cid);

// 4. Share the x402 gateway URL
// https://your-gateway.mypinata.cloud/x402/cid/{cid}
```

## Why Use Payment Instructions

Payment Instructions enable you to monetize your private content by setting custom payment requirements and receiving payments directly to your wallet.

Key benefits:
- **You get paid** for your content. Set your own prices and receive USDC payments directly.
- **Flexible pricing** for different files or groups of files
- **Reusable payment instructions** that can be attached to multiple CIDs
- **Full control** over payment requirements, pricing, and access
