Get started monetizing your private IPFS files with x402 in just a few minutes.

With x402, you monetize your private files by setting payment requirements. Payments go directly to your wallet. You control the price and receive the funds.

<Note>
  Before starting, ensure the x402 feature flag is enabled on your account. Contact team@pinata.cloud if you need access.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- Pinata account with x402 feature flag enabled
- API JWT from [Pinata App](https://app.pinata.cloud/developers/api-keys)
- Private file uploaded to Pinata
- Ethereum wallet address to receive payments

## Step 1: Upload a Private File

First, upload a file to Private IPFS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://uploads.pinata.cloud/v3/files \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
  -F "file=@your-file.pdf" \
  -F "network=private"
```

```typescript TypeScript
const JWT = "YOUR_PINATA_JWT";

const formData = new FormData();
const file = new File(["file contents"], "your-file.pdf", {
  type: "application/pdf",
});
formData.append("file", file);
formData.append("network", "private");

const upload = await fetch("https://uploads.pinata.cloud/v3/files", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
  },
  body: formData,
});
const uploadResponse = await upload.json();
const cid = uploadResponse.data.cid;
```

</CodeGroup>

Save the returned `cid` for the next step.

## Step 2: Create a Payment Instruction

Define your payment requirements:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.pinata.cloud/v3/x402/payment_instructions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Premium Content Access",
    "description": "One-time payment for file access",
    "payment_requirements": [
      {
        "asset": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
        "pay_to": "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS",
        "network": "base",
        "description": "Access fee",
        "max_amount_required": "10000"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

```typescript TypeScript
const JWT = "YOUR_PINATA_JWT";

const instruction = await fetch(
  "https://api.pinata.cloud/v3/x402/payment_instructions",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: "Premium Content Access",
      description: "One-time payment for file access",
      payment_requirements: [
        {
          asset: "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
          pay_to: "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS", // YOU receive payments here
          network: "base",
          description: "Access fee",
          max_amount_required: "10000",
        },
      ],
    }),
  }
);
const instructionResponse = await instruction.json();
const instructionId = instructionResponse.data.id;
```

</CodeGroup>

**Understanding Payment Amounts:** The `max_amount_required` uses USDC's smallest unit. USDC has 6 decimals, so to convert USD to the token amount, multiply by 1,000,000:

| USD Amount | `max_amount_required` | Calculation |
|------------|----------------------|-------------|
| $0.01 | `"10000"` | $0.01 × 1,000,000 |
| $0.10 | `"100000"` | $0.10 × 1,000,000 |
| $1.00 | `"1000000"` | $1.00 × 1,000,000 |
| $5.00 | `"5000000"` | $5.00 × 1,000,000 |
| $10.00 | `"10000000"` | $10.00 × 1,000,000 |

**Formula:** USD Amount × 1,000,000 = token amount

**Networks:**
- Production: Use `"base"` with `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`
- Testing: Use `"base-sepolia"` with `0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e`

Save the returned `id` for the next step.

## Step 3: Attach CID to Payment Instruction

Link your private file to the payment instruction:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X PUT https://api.pinata.cloud/v3/x402/payment_instructions/{instruction_id}/cids/{cid} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT"
```

```typescript TypeScript
const JWT = "YOUR_PINATA_JWT";

await fetch(
  `https://api.pinata.cloud/v3/x402/payment_instructions/${instructionId}/cids/${cid}`,
  {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
    },
  }
);
```

</CodeGroup>

Replace `{instruction_id}` with the ID from Step 2 and `{cid}` with the CID from Step 1.

## Step 4: Share Your Monetized Content

Your file is now monetized! Share this URL with requesters:

```
https://your-gateway.mypinata.cloud/x402/cid/{cid}
```

<Note>
  Replace `your-gateway.mypinata.cloud` with your actual dedicated Pinata gateway domain (e.g., `my-gateway.mypinata.cloud`), and `{cid}` with your file's CID.
</Note>

## Step 5: Test the Payment Flow

When a requester accesses your URL without payment, the gateway returns a 402 response with payment requirements:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://your-gateway.mypinata.cloud/x402/cid/{cid}
```

```typescript TypeScript
const response = await fetch(
  `https://your-gateway.mypinata.cloud/x402/cid/${cid}`
);
const paymentRequirements = await response.json();
console.log(paymentRequirements);
```

</CodeGroup>

Response:

```json
{
  "x402Version": 1,
  "accepts": [{
    "scheme": "exact",
    "network": "base",
    "maxAmountRequired": "10000",
    "asset": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
    "payTo": "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS",
    "resource": "https://your-gateway.mypinata.cloud/x402/cid/{cid}"
  }],
  "error": "Provide a valid X-Payment header to access this content"
}
```

After payment is made, requesters can access the file by including the payment proof in the `X-Payment` header.

## Next Steps

- **Manage Multiple Files**: Attach multiple CIDs to the same payment instruction
- **Update Pricing**: Use the [Update Payment Instruction](/api-reference/endpoint/x402/payment-instructions-update) endpoint
- **Monitor Access**: Check your gateway analytics to track paid downloads
- **Requester Guide**: Learn how requesters access paid content in the [Accessing Paid Content](/files/x402-accessing-paid-content) guide

## Common Issues

**404 Not Found**: Verify the CID is private and correctly attached to a payment instruction

**403 Forbidden**: Check that your API key has the required permissions (`OrgFilesWrite`)

**409 Conflict**: If deleting a payment instruction fails, remove all CID attachments first
