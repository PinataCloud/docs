### 1. Install and Setup SDK

In the root of your project run the install command with your package manager of choice.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i pinata
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm i pinata
```

```bash yarn
yarn add pinata
```

```bash bun
bun i pinata
```

</CodeGroup>

Import and initialize the SDK in your codebase with the API key and Gateway from the previous step

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: "PINATA_JWT",
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});
```

<Note>The `PINATA_JWT` is a secret key, be sure to initialize the SDK in a secure environment and practice basic variable security practices. If you need to upload from a client environment, consider using signed JWTs</Note>


### 2. Upload a File

Use the `upload` method to upload a File object.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

async function main() {
  try {
    const file = new File(["hello"], "Testing.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
    const upload = await pinata.upload.file(file);
    console.log(upload);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

await main();
```

```typescript API
const JWT = "PINATA_JWT";

async function uploadFile() {
  try {
    const text = "Hello World!";
    const blob = new Blob([text], { type: "text/plain" });
    const file = new File([blob], "hello-world.txt");
    const data = new FormData();
    data.append("file", file);

    const request = await fetch(
      "https://uploads.pinata.cloud/v3/files",
      {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
        },
        body: data,
      }
    );
    const response = await request.json();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

await pinFileToIPFS();
```
</CodeGroup>

You should get a response object like the one below

```typescript
{
    id: "349f1bb2-5d59-4cab-9966-e94c028a05b7",
    name: "file.txt",
    cid: "bafybeihgxdzljxb26q6nf3r3eifqeedsvt2eubqtskghpme66cgjyw4fra",
    size: 4682779,
    number_of_files: 1,
    mime_type: "text/plain",
    user_id: "7a484d2c-4219-4f80-9d9d-86b42461e71a",
    group_id: null
}
```

The unique thing about Pinata's File API is the CID or Content Identifier. Its a unique hash based on the content ofthe file.

### 3. Retrieve a File through a Gateway

Use the `cid` of a file to fetch it through a Gateway, or create a signed URL.

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

async function main() {
  try {
    const data = await pinata.gateways.get("bafkreibm6jg3ux5qumhcn2b3flc3tyu6dmlb4xa7u5bf44yegnrjhc4yeq");
    console.log(data)

    const url = await pinata.gateways.createSignedURL({
       	cid: "bafkreib4pqtikzdjlj4zigobmd63lig7u6oxlug24snlr6atjlmlza45dq",
    	expires: 1800,
    })
    console.log(url)
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

main();
```
