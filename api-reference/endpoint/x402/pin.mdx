## Example Usage

In order to access these endpoints you will need to use either [`x402-axios`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/x402-axios) or [`x402-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/x402-fetch). Once installed you will also need either [Viem](https://viem.sh) or a Coinbase developer account. From there you can create an `account` locally or through the CDP Wallet API.

When you make a request to one of the Pinata x402 endpoints it will return a 402 error saying payment is required. Then the `fetchWithPayment` method from the fetch or axios library will make a second requst for the requested payment amount. After payment is settled then you can use the returned presigned URL to upload the file to Pinata.

```typescript
import { wrapFetchWithPayment, decodeXPaymentResponse } from "x402-fetch";
import { account } from "./viem";

const fetchWithPayment = wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, account);

const url = "https://402.pinata.cloud/v1/pin/public";

fetchWithPayment(url, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    fileSize: 5000000,
  }),
})
  .then(async (response) => {
    const body = (await response.json()) as { url: string };
    console.log(body);

    const uuid = crypto.randomUUID();

    const file = new File([`Paid and pinned by 402.pinata.cloud: ${uuid}`], "file.txt");

    const data = new FormData();
    data.append("network", "public");
    data.append("file", file);

    const uploadReq = await fetch(body.url, {
      method: "POST",
      body: data,
    });

    const uploadRes = await uploadReq.json();
    console.log(uploadRes);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error.response?.data?.error);
  });
```

Uploading files to Public IPFS means you can access them through a gateway like `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/:CID`. If you upload a file as `private` then it will not be accessible on public IPFS, so in order to access it you need to create a temporary access URL. This flow is similar to the previous one, except you would provide the CID that you uploded previously that you would like to access. After a successful payment the server will return a URL you can access the file with.

```typescript
import { wrapFetchWithPayment, decodeXPaymentResponse } from "x402-fetch";
import { account } from "./viem";

const fetchWithPayment = wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, account);

const url =
  "https://402.pinata.cloud/v1/retrieve/private/bafkreih5aznjvttude6c3wbvqeebb6rlx5wkbzyppv7garjiubll2ceym4";

fetchWithPayment(url, {
  method: "GET",
})
  .then(async (response) => {
    const body = (await response.json()) as { url: string };
    console.log(body);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error.response?.data?.error);
  });
```
