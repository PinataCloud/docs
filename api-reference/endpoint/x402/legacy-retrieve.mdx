## Example Usage

If you upload a file as `private` then it will not be accessible on public IPFS, so in order to access it you need to create a temporary access URL. This flow is similar to the previous one, except you would provide the CID that you uploded previously that you would like to access. After a successful payment the server will return a URL you can access the file with.

```typescript
import { wrapFetchWithPayment, decodeXPaymentResponse } from "x402-fetch";
import { account } from "./viem";

const fetchWithPayment = wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, account);

const url =
	"https://402.pinata.cloud/v1/retrieve/private/bafkreih5aznjvttude6c3wbvqeebb6rlx5wkbzyppv7garjiubll2ceym4";

fetchWithPayment(url, {
	method: "GET",
})
	.then(async (response) => {

		const body = (await response.json()) as { url: string };
		console.log(body);

	})
	.catch((error) => {
		console.error(error.response?.data?.error);
	});
```
